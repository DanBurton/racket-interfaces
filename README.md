Typeclass-esque generics for Racket

A work in progress.

Priorities
==========

Tier 1:  
Truly first class instances  
Not "too dynamic"

Tier 2:  
"define" syntax  
allow supporting defines

Tier 3:  
super/sub-interfaces  
ad-hoc interface extension  
macro friendly  
nice error messages

Tier 4:  
contracts  
quick-checkables  
typed/racket friendly  
speed  
efficiency (first-order instances)  
integration with current generics system  
more examples
